# MetaMask Docs

This is the MetaMask documentation repo. It's built on [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a static site generator purpose-built for technical documentation.

## Features

Our instance of Docusaurus uses multiple of its powerful features, including:

* [Multi-instance](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docs-multi-instance): we have two instances of docs, one for the API & SDK, and one for Snaps
* [Versioning](https://docusaurus.io/docs/versioning): the Snaps documentation is exposed in two versions, "current" and "next". This allows us to send developers to either of these two versions based on whether they're using a nightly build of Flask, or the officially published extension
* [MDX](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react#importing-markdown)
* [Custom Sidebars](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar): normally sidebars are auto-generated based on the docs directory structure. Having a custom sidebar allows us to define the order and inclusion of documentation items, with any hierarchy we want. The current proposed hierarchy is here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fr1qnP830Zrdbzq0rPvoTVQsYBwL2Sq-wEJjL4tGfM8/edit

## MDX

### Tabs
Tabs are documented here: https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/tabs

#### Markdown in Tabs
One thing that's not documented is how to properly do Markdown inside tabs. For example, to properly embed a list inside a tab item, one has to skip lines around the JSX tags, and un-indent the list. Otherwise, the 4 spaces will be mistaken as the start of a pre-formatted block:

```jsx
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="apple" label="Apple" default>

- This is a markdown apple üçé
- This is **meow**


  </TabItem> {/* notice **two** skipped lines above*/}
  <TabItem value="orange" label="Orange">
    This is an orange üçä
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="banana" label="Banana">
    This is a banana üçå
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```
